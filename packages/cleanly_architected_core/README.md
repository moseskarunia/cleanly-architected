# cleanly_architected_core

The core library of cleanly_architected for more flexible dependencies. This way, you can implement the platform and state manager of your choice.

## Planned Updates
- Form caching in Mutation Repository: Make it easier for you to save form state, to enable user to continue editing later.
- `SortParams` when querying
- Subscription data source, repo, and interactor

Feel free to submit PR for them. The functions already available in the data source though, the repository just need to wire things up.
